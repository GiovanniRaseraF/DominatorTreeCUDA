// PROBLEM: 
// Write a program that, given a node x in V (different from s), 
//      determines a subset D of nodes such that: 
// 1) the source s does not belong to D, and the node x does not belong to D 
// 2) every directed path from s to x passes through at least one node in D 
// 3) D is minimal with respect to cardinality 
//      (i.e., there is no other set that satisfies properties 1 and 2 and has fewer elements than D)

// SOLUTION: MaxFlowMinCut algorithm

// MaxFlowMinCut

// Main
int main(){
