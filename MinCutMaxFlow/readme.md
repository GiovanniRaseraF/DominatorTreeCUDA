## Problem Description
- Write a program that, given a node x in V (different from s), determines a subset D of nodes such that: 
    1.  the source s does not belong to D, and the node x does not belong to D 
    2. every directed path from s to x passes through at least one node in D 
    3. D is minimal with respect to cardinality 
      (i.e., there is no other set that satisfies properties 1 and 2 and has fewer elements than D)

## Solution
- MinCutMaxFlow algorithm

## Implementation
### Sequential 
- Ford-Folkerson algorithm
    - Uses bfs and dfs to determinate if the last node can be reached
    - Uses a new Graph called G' generate from G tha allows the algorithm to cut Nodes and not edges
- Kargerâ€™s Algorithm
    - It'a a Monte Carlo algorithm that uses super nodes and super adges and random choises to subdivide the graph

### Parallel
- TODO: implement parallel algo


## How to compile
### Sequential
```bash
make # V = 1024 just run once
#
make test --silent # V encreases every run
```
### Parallel
```bash
# TODO: to implement
```
